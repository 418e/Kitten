# Welcome to Kitten

Kitten is an open-source HTML template compiler written in Rust. The goal of Kitten is to simplify the syntax of HTML to make coding more comfortable for developers and eliminate the need for closing tags. We also aim to simplify the process of building modern web applications and make the developer experience a top priority.

## Why Kitten?

Kitten was created to address the complexities and verbosity of traditional HTML. By eliminating the need for closing tags and providing a more streamlined syntax, Kitten makes it easier and more efficient to write HTML code. We also want to integrate javascript inside our codebase without complicating developer experience

## How to Use These Docs

On the left side of the screen, you'll find the docs navbar. The pages of the docs are organized sequentially, from basic to advanced, so you can follow them step-by-step when building your application. However, you can read them in any order or skip to the pages that apply to your use case.

On the right side of the screen, you'll see a table of contents that makes it easier to navigate between sections of a page. If you need to quickly find a page, you can use the search bar at the top, or the search shortcut (Ctrl+K or Cmd+K).
