# Kitten Extension

Kitten has its own extension for syntax highlighting and code formatting. Extension is aviable for only VSCode for now. You can install it from [Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TronLang.kitten), or just search `Kitten` in the extension search bar.
